This is intelligence tool on analyzing data.
iat = intelligence analytics tool

-----------------

observation -> assertion -> estimation -> conclusion

First of all I have to create data lake.
There I will store all the information I gather.
 * Information which I got in real life (in talk, for example)
 * Information which I get from internet


To make any assertion I must have aim, taks, in which direction this judgjment will be done.
So I must be able to create new spaces for each aim I want to eachive.
There must be possiblity to add attributes to the workspace.
Those aims could be understanding what is person planning to do or my plans to go on holidays and how to organize it and so on.

There I will be attach (or create) data which is related to the aim.

Each data must be described to be used. So I must be able to create objects, which describe given data or set of data.

As well, this app must have tools for analyzing data and generating reports/data.
The next stage of this is making assertions.

Assertions is in fact hipotezise, which is based on data I have.
So in this programm, there must be possibility to create separate subworkspace where I will trying to
order information to make any assertions.
Maybe that will be simply a group of data and reports, where below will be described my summury about that data and some
kind ofproof for that.

Then I might give estimation for the situatiation. This is a place where come to place assertions, data and reports.
That subworkspace might look subworkspace for assertion but there assetions will be used for summaries and reports as well.

Then I might make conclusion.
The same subworkspace as in assertions and estimates, but all I have will be used to make that conclusion.


Raport - could be any data, which is based on another data and datasets. For example statistical data.
Assertion, estimation, conlusion - are statements.

Summary:
    - data lake: there will be gathering all data from
        - real life
        - from internet
    - working space: to interpretate data I must have aim, so I have to create separate workspace for each aim.
        - I can add attributes to aim workspace.
            Those attributes will describe an aim.
        - I must be able to attach data from data lake to this workspace.
        - tools to analyze data and generating reports/data. Maybe console or somthing like that.
        - creating object, which will describe raw data
        - In this workspace I must be able to answer on aim. There might be an object os somthing like that, which
            will gather all data, assertions, estimates, conclusions and reports as well which are answering and describing an aim I have.
            For example, if I gather information on person, so this super-object might store information about name, living place, telephone,
            an information where he/she was last sunday, his debt to me and so on.
        - Workspace is somthing that is rarely changed, so it might be setted as context of work. So it will be easily attach data to workspace.
            Because "plus" will immidiatly mean, that this data is attached to this workspace, without need to select it.

    - subworkspace for each assertion (the same for estimation and conclusion subworkspaces)
        - i can attach data and reports to the assertion subworkspace
        - assertion is statemaent which is based on information and reports and given proof. (maybe that proof will be below)
            as well, I can use other assertions, estimates and conclusions in the subworkspace.
